# Sopsync - A Versatile Shopping List Web App

Sopsync is a web application designed to simplify your shopping experience. This project showcases my proficiency in React.js and core front-end technologies, with a deliberate focus on React's core capabilities, including state management and the Context API, instead of relying on libraries like Redux.

## Key Features

- **React Core Focus:** Sopsync demonstrates the power of React's fundamental state management and the Context API. It intentionally avoids the use of external libraries like Redux to highlight my mastery of React's core features.

- **List Management System:** Create, manage, and organize your shopping lists effortlessly. Save lists to local storage and delete them when you're done.

- **List Status Control:** Mark your shopping lists as "Running" while actively shopping or "Complete" when you finish.

- **Customizable Items:** Tailor your shopping lists to your specific needs. Select items from predefined categories or create custom items with quantities and prices.

- **Filtering by Status:** Easily filter your lists by status, focusing on "Complete," "Running," or viewing all lists for improved organization.

- **Invoice Printing:** Generate and print invoices for a clear overview of items and costs to enhance your shopping experience.

## Why Sopsync?

- **React Core Emphasis:** By deliberately avoiding libraries like Redux, Sopsync showcases my dedication to mastering React's core capabilities and state management.

- **Practical Application:** Sopsync addresses a real-world need by simplifying the shopping process, demonstrating my ability to develop functional and user-friendly web applications.

- **Versatility:** This project highlights my capacity to create feature-rich and adaptable applications with features like custom item creation, status filtering, and invoice printing.

## Challenges

- **Complex UI:** While the primary focus was on functionality, designing an aesthetically pleasing user interface was a challenge, pushing me to enhance my UI/UX design skills.

- **Local Storage:** Implementing local storage for saving lists required careful consideration of data persistence and handling edge cases, contributing to my proficiency in data management.
